<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Ankit, a full-stack web developer with a passion for creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly<br/>
    websites and applications. I thrive on bringing ideas to life through clean, high-quality code.</p>

<p>My journey into web development started with a curiosity about how websites work. After earning my<br/>
   degree in BCA, I have been developing custom websites and applications for over two years.</p>

<p>I specialize in full-stack development using technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.<br/>
   I also have experience working with databases, RESTful APIs, and cloud services like AWS and Firebase.</p>

<p>My development philosophy revolves around writing clean, maintainable code and building websites<br/>
   that are both efficient and scalable. I’m always looking for ways to optimize performance and improve<br/>
   user experience.</p>
<p>I’ve had the pleasure of working with startups and established companies to create custom web <br/>solutions. Some of my notable projects include building e-commerce platforms, SaaS applications, and<br/>
    real-time chat systems. My contributions have also been recognized in open-source communities.</p>
<p>I’m always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with teams on innovative projects. If <br/>you’re looking for a developer who can turn your ideas into reality, feel free to contact me at <br/>
